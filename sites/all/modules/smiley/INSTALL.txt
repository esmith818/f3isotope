Installation
-------------------

1. Extract and copy the contents of the smiley package to the Drupal
   "sites/all/modules" directory.

2. Go to the Modules administration page and enable the Smiley module.

3. Go to "Configuration > Content authoring > Text formats" and enable the
   Smiley filtering for your preferred Input formats (e.g. Filtered HTML).
   NOTE: Make sure that "Smileys filter" is placed below "Limit allowed HTML
   tags" under the "Filter processing order" settings. Otherwise, your smileys
   may not show up.

4. Go to "Configuration > Content authoring > Smileys" and add your own smiley
   either manually or by importing packs (see README.txt).
