Description
-----------

This is a simple smiley-filter that allows the easy use of graphical smileys (or
'emoticons') on a Drupal site. It comes with a set of example smileys, but you
can define an unlimited amount of custom smileys as well.

You can add your own Smiley by importing ready to use packages available on the
internet (e.g. phpBB emoticon "pak"s and Adium Emoticon packs). Extract them
into FILES_DIRECTORY/smiley (usually sites/default/files/smiley) folder and
import using the "Smiley Import" module.

Installation
------------

Please read INSTALL.txt

Usage Notes
-----------

1. A smiley acronym cannot contain a space. For example, instead of
"*THUMBS UP*", use "*THUMBS_UP*", "*THUMBS-UP*", etc.

NOTE: Please don't rip the Example and Roving smileys and use them without this
module. Their creators spent quite some time creating those little buggers for
dedicated use with the smiley module.
