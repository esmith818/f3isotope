Node Notify
===========

Introduction
------------

Node Notify is a lightweight module to allow subscription to comments
on nodes for registered and anonymous users.

It was specifically designed to integrate with Comment Notify, i.e. Node
Notify will not send email notifications if they are sent by Comment
Notify.

When configured, Node Notify will place:

- checkbox on a subscription enabled node's form for node author if
  he/she is registered user or text field for email address if
  anonymous;

- "Subscribe" or "Unsubscribe" link in node's links area for other
  users when in full view;

- "Subscriptions" tab on user profile page with ability to enable or
  disable existing subscriptions.


Requirements
------------

Node Notify requires Token module for email templates and core Node
and Comment modules.

Node Notify was tested against Comment Notify version 7.x-1.0. Comment
Notify is NOT required for Node Notify to work.


Installation
------------

There are no special installation steps. Drop it in site modules
folder and enable it. By default Node Notify does not alter appearance
of nodes and does not sent any notifications.
